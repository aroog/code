Architectural Reasoning based on Ownership Object Graphs (OOGs)
===============================================================

Main applications of OOGs:

* Security Constraints On RuntIme Architecture (Scoria): security analysis;
* Static Conformance cHecking of Object-based structuraL vIews of Architecture (SCHOLIA): conformance to target architecture;
* Object Graph REfinement (OOGRE): guide the inference of ownership type qualifiers based on interactive manipulation of an object graph;

List of projects:
-----------------

* Simple.XML: Eclipse-based wrapper for simple.xml framework
* MiniAstOOG: Simple Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation
* SecOOG: Scoria security analysis
* PointsTo: ScoriaX object graph extractor (supports Points-To, Data-flow and Control-flow edges)
* OOGEclipsePlugin: serve the results of the Eclipse analysis as JSON objects in a web-browser;
* OOGWeb: JavaScript based web client;
