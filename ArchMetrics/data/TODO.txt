Use Gnumeric

Guidelines:
- One tab per metric
- Put the data on top
- Put the charts at the bottom
- Make the charts of the same size, so when they are exported to EPS, they will all be of the same size in the paper.


- Right-click on a chart, Save as Image, and under File Type, pick EPS.

- Figure out if we can change the default settings for all the charts: 
-- Colors that are easy to read in a B&W printout;
-- Font; 
-- Background color (avoid gray);
-- etc.
