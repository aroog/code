Add options for the Map:

- List of excludes

- Use package, or list type

- Use qualified names:
-- Should be always true



TODO: Create singleton to expose the map to the rest of ArchMetrics:
- load the XML once (per invocation of the metrics)



TODO: Figure out business of location/filename of the map being loaded

TOSUM: TODO: Move stuff to Model class.

TOSUM: TODO: HIGH. Work on the GenerateDefaultMap to populate the initial map:
- Move some of the logic there
- XXX. avoid storing everything but the kitchen sink in that file
-- Try to compute things on the fly as much as possible
-- Store the minimal amount of information
-- E.g., no need to store list of abstract classes; can find out from ITypeBinding is a class is abstract
-- E.g., no need to store list of interfaces; can find out from ITypeBinding is a type is an interface

TOSUM: TODO: LOW. Add feature to validate the contents of the file:
- e.g., check for duplicates
- check for inconsistencies between the lists
-- e.g., the same type is listed both as a framework type AND an application type 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XXX. Need to look at some of entries in metrics_map.xml:
- File is not a DataClass (which means a class with just fields, getters/setters, no behavior)
-- File has a ton of a behavior: Open, Close, Read, Write, etc.

- Position could be a DataClass: it just stores (x,y) coordinates

XXX. Let's collect all the unsure classifiers, then revise them for all systems
